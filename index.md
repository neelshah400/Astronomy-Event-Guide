# Astronomy Event Guide

Science Olympiad &middot; Division C &middot; 2019

## Overview

Astronomy is a 2-person testing event, usually lasting 50 minutes. Each student can bring either a 3-ring binder of any size or a computer/tablet disconnected from the internet. We strongly recommend using a laptop, as you have access to much more information and do not have to deal with the hassle of printing. Additionally, each student is allowed to bring any type of calculator. The event focuses on 3 main content areas:

- General topics &mdash;  these are theory-based questions pertaining to an assortment of topics. Many of the areas remain the same from year to year, but some of them do change.
- Math &mdash;  these are calculations involving the principles of astrophysics and circular motion. In general, these remain the same every year.
- Deep sky objects &mdash; these are astronomical objects that you will be tested on. DSO questions involve theory as well as identification.

More information about the event can be found in the [rules document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aOEBoKRi1Ayk3hBHBemDybuB314mCop8/view?usp=sharing) for 2019.

## How to Prepare for the Event

### Wikipedia

Astronomy is a very comprehensive event, covering a wide berth of topics. As such, because it is impossible to have an in-depth understanding of everything you could be asked in a competition, Wikipedia will be your best friend. The offline version gives you a fast and resourceful tool when prior knowledge and studying do not yield the answer. To download Wikipedia:

1. Download [Wikipedia.taxi](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12O8-dlKxlXH4V1L2Dts8KAuVXOPfES5A/view?usp=sharing).
2. Go to the [WikiTaxi](https://www.yunqa.de/delphi/products/wikitaxi/index) website. Download the Win64 version, and launch the application.
3. Press the ```Options``` button in the top-right, click on ```Open *.taxi Database```, and select your ```Wikipedia.taxi``` file.
4. You should now be able to search Wikipedia offline.

Some information displays incorrectly, however, so feel free to try other alternatives to WikiTaxi. We used Xowa in addition to Wikitaxi. Installation instructions can be found [here](http://xowa.org/).

### Notes

Although Wikipedia is a great resource, it should not be your sole source of information. There is no replacement for taking notes. We decided to use OneNote for the following reasons:

- Ability to search for terms and phrases across all documents and PDFs.
- Ability to organize notes using a nested structure.
- Ability to collaborate with teammates, like in Google Docs.

Our OneNote notebook can be accessed [here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Apcl7amPaGsGgaoDumiYcJQazmcwFQ?e=UjgB3d).

Several topics in the Astronomy event remain constant throughout the years. As such, instead of starting fresh with your own notes, it can be useful to have some sort of starting ground from which you can add additional content as you see fit. DSOs rotate per year, and some of the topics change out as well, so make sure not to rely entirely on this resource, and to add your own notes to gain knowledge and understanding.

## Tips

### General Topics

TBA.

### Math

TBA.

### Deep Sky Objects

Each year, there are approximately 15 deep sky objects, which vary each year. It is recommended that you categorize the DSOs and then take notes. My procedure for each is as follows:

1. List other designations of the DSO.
2. Summarize important information.
3. Make a table of characteristics/observation data.
4. Do research, and take notes using [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page).
5. List any references that may be useful.
6. Download the [Google Images](https://images.google.com/) results for the DSO for identification purposes on tests.
7. Download PDFs of any references that may be useful.

## Practice Tests

Tests can be found on the [wiki](https://scioly.org/wiki/index.php/2019_Test_Exchange) or [scioly.org](https://scioly.org/tests/). Tests we found useful can be found in the [OneNote notebook](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Apcl7amPaGsGgaoDumiYcJQazmcwFQ?e=UjgB3d).
